A new commit from the branch: **new-branch**

This will be the conflicting line. **main**.
New line inserted. **new-branch**

`git branch **<branch-name>**` -Creates a branch with given **branch-name**.  
`git checkout **<branch-name>**` -Switches to the stated branch.  
`git merge **<branch-to-merge>**` - After everything's done, merge branch.  

If there are merge conflicts:

   - Open problematic file, and do changes manually.
   - `git add .` and `git commit -m "<Commit message>"`

END
